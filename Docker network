Docker Networking | Bridge vs Host vs Overlay and custom bridge networks: 

1. Create two containers using bridge network and third isolated using custon bridge network.
2. C1 and C2 can communicate but they can not to C3 as that is on secure another network.

a. Create C1 : docker run -d --name login nginx:latest
-Login : docker exec -it login /bin/bash
-install ping : apt-get install iputils-ping -y
-check status : ping -v

b. Create C2 : docker run -d --name logout nginx:latest
-Check : docker ps
-Check IP's : docker inspect login/logout
-List networks : docker network ls
-Ping C1 to C2 : ping C1 ip.  // can ping 

c. Create C3 : docker run -d --name finance --network=secure-network nginx:latest
-Get IP : docker inspect finance
-check ping and it will not connect to C1 and C2 as C3 is in secure custom NW.

d. Create C4 on host NW:
-docker run -d --name host-demo --network=host nginx:latest
-Check inspect : docker inspect host   // will not show ip as it is on host same network
